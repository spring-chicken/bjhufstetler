            <div class="author">
                <p>I am a mechanical engineer and space operations officer serving in the United States Space Force as a NASA CapCom for the International Space Station. I have worked as the Space Sciences Department Head at the Space Force's premier technical school, as the chief satellite engineer of a $30B constellation, as an air quality monitoring engineer, as a middle school English and Calculus teacher in South Korea, and as a fantastic line cook and dishwasher.</p>
                <p>I love teaching orbital mechanics and exploring Fermi style rabbit holes. I also like running, biking, reading, and listening to podcasts. You can find me on <a href="https://x.com/bjhufstetler">X</a> but my feed is mostly just a bunch of space news reposts.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: My five-person D&D group played the same campaign every week for eight straight years! I am also honored to have been the proud recipient of the <a href="https://geeklyinc.com/">GeeklyInc</a> Geekly of the Year Award.</p>
                <p>All opinions are my own.</p>
